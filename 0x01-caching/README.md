# Caching 
Caching Systems are Hardware/Software Based storage layer implementations that Temporaril store queried data from core storage layers of systems to improve latency and IOPS metrics for data requests.<br>
Their Major Purpose is to increase the Performance of Data Retrieval Operations through cutting necessities of accesing the slower deeper data layers.<br>

## [Some Popular Caching Policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies)
* FIFO <br>
* LIFO <br>
* LRU [Least Recently Used] <br>
* MRU [Most Recently used] <br>
* LFU [Least Frequently used] <br>
